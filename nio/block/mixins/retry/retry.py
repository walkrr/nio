class Retry(object):
    """ A block mixin that provides retry functionality.

    By including this mixin, your block will have access to a method that can
    retry on failure. This is useful when performing tasks that have a chance
    of failing but can then work upon retrying. Example use cases are database
    queries or other requests over a network.

    When this mixin is added to a block, some hidden retry configuration
    options will be added to the block. These options allow the block
    configurer to determine how retries should occur, including what strategy
    should be used.

    Block developers can implement their own backoff strategies and employ
    those instead by overriding the setup_backoff_strategy method.

    How to use this mixin:
        1. Configure your block by selecting a backoff strategy as well as
        providing some options to determine how long it will wait between
        retries.

        2. Call execute_with_retry with the function that you want to execute.
        If the target function raises an exception, it will retry until it
        either succeeds or the backoff strategy has decided it should stop
        retrying. If that occurs, execute_with_retry will raise the exception
        that the target function raised originally.

        3. Optionally, override before_retry to write custom code that will be
        performed before attempting a retry.

    Block parameters:
        strategy (select): A choice of pre-configured backoff strategies
        max_retry (int): The maximum number of retries to attempt. Note that
            this is based on retry number, not retry duration. Setting it to
            0 means that no retries will be attempted. Setting it to a negative
            number means that there is no maximum. Also note that this
            property works in concert with the indefinite flag. If that flag
            is set to True, then the retry duration for the retry number
            specified in max_retry will be retried indefinitely.
        multiplier (float): This property has slightly different meanings
            based on what strategy is being used, but for the most part, it
            allows you to control how much time will elapse between retries.
            The higher the number, the longer amount of time that will elapse
            between each retry attempt.
        indefinite (bool): Set to True if you wish for the max_retry retry
            attempt to be continued indefinitely. For example, if this is true
            and max_retry is 5, then the 5th retry will continue to be retried
            until the retry is successful or the block is stopped. If this
            flag is set to False, the retry mixin will stop retrying once the
            max_retry retry attempt is reached.
