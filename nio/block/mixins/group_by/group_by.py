    """ Use this base class to extend block functionality to groups of signals

    Use NIO's native expression syntax to configure a value by which to
    group signals. In your block's 'process_signals' method, pass the
    list of signals and a target method to self.for_each_group. The
    signals will be grouped automatically and the target method called
    on each group in turn.

    If you'd like to map a function over all the groups outside of
    process_signals, just call self.for_each_group without passing any
    signals.

    You can also make use of the default process_signals implmentation of
    grouping all incoming signals and processing them independently by not
    overriding process_signals but instead overriding process_group_signals.

    Properties:
        group_by: The expression by which signals will be grouped.
