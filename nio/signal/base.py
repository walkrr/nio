""" The definition of a Signal

A signal is the fundamental unit of information in n.io. Functionally, it
is a key-value object that can contain any information that Python can
represent. Conceptually, a signal can represent any piece of information. It
can be as simple as an empty signal representing some sort of ping or as
complex as a signal with many attributes containing various pieces of
information.

The base signal does not impose very many rules or restricitions, but the class
is intended to be extended and sub-classed to have more validation and
functionality for different types of data.
