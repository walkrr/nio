    """ A base class for creating a ModuleProxy interface

  A ModuleProxy is similar to an interface - it allows for separating the
  interface for accessing a class and the implementation controlling how it
  works.

  To create a ModuleProxy interface, create a class that inherits from the
  ModuleProxy class. Define methods and class variables in your interface with
  the method signatures you want people to use when calling them. These
  functions can have as much or as little functionality as you want. Once the
  proxy is "proxied" with an implementation class, any methods defined on the
  implementation class will be proxied and overridden on to the interface.

  After the interface is proxied, people can create an object as if they are
  creating the interface - the caller does not need to know the type or
  location of the implementation class.

  To create an implementation for a ModuleProxy, create a class that does NOT
  inherit from ModuleProxy. Define functionality for whatever methods on the
  interface you want. You can define additional methods in your class that can
  be accessed by the other methods in your implementation. Be aware though that
  since these methods are not on the interface, it should not be assumed that
  the caller can call them or even knows they exist.

  Once the implementation class is complete, call the proxy method on the
  interface passing in the reference to the implementation class.

  Example - this will proxy the members of the ImplementationClass on to the
  InterfaceProxyClass:

      >>> InterfaceProxyClass.proxy(ImplementationClass)

        for its constructor.

        Therefore, a proxy interface should define its __init__ method with
        the desired signature, and call super with the same arguments. The
        __init__ method of the proxy implementation will NOT be proxied to the
